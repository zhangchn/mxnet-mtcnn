def norm(x, ord=None, axis=None, keepdims=False):
    r"""Matrix or vector norm.

    This function can only support Frobenius norm for now.
    The Frobenius norm is given by [1]_:

        :math:`||A||_F = [\sum_{i,j} abs(a_{i,j})^2]^{1/2}`

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        Input array.
    ord : {'fro'}, optional
        Order of the norm.
    axis : {int, 2-tuple of ints, None}, optional
        If `axis` is an integer, it specifies the axis of `x` along which to
        compute the vector norms.  If `axis` is a 2-tuple, it specifies the
        axes that hold 2-D matrices, and the matrix norms of these matrices
        are computed.  If `axis` is None, the norm of the whole ndarray is
        returned.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are normed over are left in the
        result as dimensions with size one.  With this option the result will
        broadcast correctly against the original `x`.

    Returns
    -------
    n : float or ndarray
        Norm of the matrix or vector(s).

def svd(a):
    r"""
    Singular Value Decomposition.

    When `a` is a 2D array, it is factorized as ``ut @ np.diag(s) @ v``,
    where `ut` and `v` are 2D orthonormal arrays and `s` is a 1D
    array of `a`'s singular values. When `a` is higher-dimensional, SVD is
    applied in stacked mode as explained below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, N) _Symbol
        A real array with ``a.ndim >= 2`` and ``M <= N``.

    Returns
    -------
    ut: (..., M, M) _Symbol
        Orthonormal array(s). The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
        size as those of the input `a`.
    s : (..., M) _Symbol
        Vector(s) with the singular values, within each vector sorted in
        descending order. The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
        size as those of the input `a`.
    v : (..., M, N) _Symbol
        Orthonormal array(s). The first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions have the same
        size as those of the input `a`.

    Notes
    -----

    The decomposition is performed using LAPACK routine ``_gesvd``.

    SVD is usually described for the factorization of a 2D matrix :math:`A`.
    The higher-dimensional case will be discussed below. In the 2D case, SVD is
    written as :math:`A = U^T S V`, where :math:`A = a`, :math:`U^T = ut`,
    :math:`S= \mathtt{np.diag}(s)` and :math:`V = v`. The 1D array `s`
    contains the singular values of `a` and `ut` and `v` are orthonormal. The rows
    of `v` are the eigenvectors of :math:`A^T A` and the columns of `ut` are
    the eigenvectors of :math:`A A^T`. In both cases the corresponding
    (possibly non-zero) eigenvalues are given by ``s**2``.

    The sign of rows of `u` and `v` are determined as described in
    `Auto-Differentiating Linear Algebra <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08717.pdf>`_.

    If `a` has more than two dimensions, then broadcasting rules apply.
    This means that SVD is working in "stacked" mode: it iterates over
    all indices of the first ``a.ndim - 2`` dimensions and for each
    combination SVD is applied to the last two indices. The matrix `a`
    can be reconstructed from the decomposition with either
    ``(ut * s[..., None, :]) @ v`` or
    ``ut @ (s[..., None] * v)``. (The ``@`` operator denotes batch matrix multiplication)

    This function differs from the original `numpy.linalg.svd
    <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.svd.html>`_ in
    the following way(s):
     - The sign of rows of `u` and `v` may differ.
     - Does not support complex input.

def cholesky(a):
    r"""
    Cholesky decomposition.

    Return the Cholesky decomposition, `L * L.T`, of the square matrix `a`,
    where `L` is lower-triangular and .T is the transpose operator. `a` must be
    symmetric and positive-definite. Only `L` is actually returned. Complex-valued
    input is currently not supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) ndarray
        Symmetric, positive-definite input matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    L : (..., M, M) ndarray
        Lower-triangular Cholesky factor of `a`.

    Raises
    ------
    MXNetError
        If the decomposition fails, for example, if `a` is not positive-definite.

    Notes
    -----
    Broadcasting rules apply.

    The Cholesky decomposition is often used as a fast way of solving

    .. math:: A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}

    (when `A` is both symmetric and positive-definite).

    First, we solve for :math:`\mathbf{y}` in

    .. math:: L \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{b},

    and then for :math:`\mathbf{x}` in

    .. math:: L.T \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> A = np.array([[16, 4], [4, 10]])
    >>> A
    array([[16.,  4.],
           [ 4., 10.]])
    >>> L = np.linalg.cholesky(A)
    >>> L
    array([[4., 0.],
           [1., 3.]])
    >>> np.dot(L, L.T)

           [ 4., 10.]])

def inv(a):
    r"""
    Compute the (multiplicative) inverse of a matrix.

    Given a square matrix `a`, return the matrix `ainv` satisfying
    ``dot(a, ainv) = dot(ainv, a) = eye(a.shape[0])``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : (..., M, M) ndarray
        Matrix to be inverted.

    Returns
    -------
    ainv : (..., M, M) ndarray
        (Multiplicative) inverse of the matrix `a`.

    Raises
    ------
    MXNetError
        If `a` is not square or inversion fails.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from mxnet import np
    >>> a = np.array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
    array([[-2. ,  1. ],
           [ 1.5, -0.5]])

    Inverses of several matrices can be computed at once:

    >>> a = np.array([[[1., 2.], [3., 4.]], [[1, 3], [3, 5]]])
    >>> np.linalg.inv(a)
    array([[[-2.        ,  1.        ],
            [ 1.5       , -0.5       ]],

           [[-1.2500001 ,  0.75000006],
