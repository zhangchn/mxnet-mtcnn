    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default

    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the

    - If either `a` or `b` is 0-D (scalar), it is equivalent to :func:`multiply`
      and using ``np.multiply(a, b)`` or ``a * b`` is preferred.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 1-D array, it is a sum product over
      the last axis of `a` and `b`.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 2-D array, it is a

def _np_sum(a, axis=None, dtype=None, keepdims=False, initial=None, out=None):
    r"""
    Sum of array elements over a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input data.
    axis : None or int, optional
        Axis or axes along which a sum is performed.  The default,
        axis=None, will sum all of the elements of the input array.  If
        axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed. The default type is float32.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `sum` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-classes `sum` method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    initial: Currently only supports None as input, optional
        Starting value for the sum.
        Currently not implemented. Please use ``None`` as input or skip this argument.
    out : ndarray or None, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape and dtype as the expected output.

    Returns
    -------
    sum_along_axis : ndarray
        An ndarray with the same shape as `a`, with the specified
        axis removed. If an output array is specified, a reference to
        `out` is returned.

    Notes
    -----
    - Input type does not support Python native iterables.
    - "out" param: cannot perform auto type change. out ndarray's dtype must be the same as the expected output.
    - "initial" param is not supported yet. Please use None as input.
    - Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is raised on overflow.
    - The sum of an empty array is the neutral element 0:

    >>> a = np.empty(1)
    >>> np.sum(a)
    array(0.)

    This function differs from the original `numpy.sum
    <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html>`_ in
    the following aspects:

    - Input type does not support Python native iterables(list, tuple, ...).
    - "out" param: cannot perform auto type cast. out ndarray's dtype must be the same as the expected output.
    - "initial" param is not supported yet. Please use ``None`` as input or skip it.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([0.5, 1.5])
    >>> np.sum(a)
    array(2.)
    >>> a = np.array([0.5, 0.7, 0.2, 1.5])

        the same shape and dtype as the expected output.

    Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.
    This function always returns a copy of the input array if

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
        an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
        One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
        inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
    order : {'C'}, optional
        Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
        elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
        means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest. Other order types such as 'F'/'A'
        may be added in the future.

    Returns
    -------
    reshaped_array : ndarray
        It will be always a copy of the original array. This behavior is different

        Input array.
    shift : int or tuple of ints
        The number of places by which elements are shifted.  If a tuple,

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a product is performed.
        The default (`axis` = `None`) is perform a product over all
        the dimensions of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
        which case it counts from the last to the first axis.
        If this is a tuple of ints, a product is performed on multiple
        axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The data-type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator
        in which the elements are multiplied.  By default, if `a` is of
        integer type, `dtype` is the default platform integer. (Note: if
        the type of `a` is unsigned, then so is `dtype`.)  Otherwise,
        the dtype is the same as that of `a`.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type of the
        output values will be cast if necessary.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.
    
    Returns
    -------
    product_along_axis : ndarray, see `dtype` parameter above.
        An array shaped as `a` but with the specified axis removed.

    Notes
    -----
    Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is

    >>> x = np.array([536870910, 536870910, 536870910, 536870910])
    >>> np.prod(x) #random
    array(8.307675e+34)
    
    Examples
    --------
    By default, calculate the product of all elements:
    
    >>> np.prod(np.array([1.,2.]))
    array(2.)
    
    Even when the input array is two-dimensional:
    
    >>> np.prod(np.array([1.,2.,3.,4.]).reshape((2,2)))
    array(24.)
    
    But we can also specify the axis over which to multiply:
    
    >>> np.prod(np.array([1.,2.,3.,4.]).reshape((2,2)), axis=1)
    array([  2.,  12.])

    If the type of `x` is unsigned, then the output type is
    the unsigned platform integer:
    
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> np.prod(x).dtype == np.uint8
    True

    If `x` is of a signed integer type, then the output type
    is the default platform integer:

    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape.
